# Kafka_S3_Integration_And_Aggregation


This repository contains Python scripts designed to facilitate the integration of Kafka streams into AWS S3 storage and perform data aggregation using ksqlDB.
It is particularly tailored for scenarios where data from Kafka topics needs to be persisted in S3 for further analysis or backup purposes and where Kafka stream data is aggregated for insights.

## Scripts Description

- `kafkaToS3.py`: This script subscribes to specified Kafka topics, retrieves messages, and stores them in AWS S3. It handles message serialization and ensures that data is appropriately formatted and stored in S3 buckets.

- `ksqldb_agg.py`: Utilizes ksqlDB to aggregate data from Kafka topics. It creates streams and tables for aggregating data based on specified criteria, aiding in the analysis of Kafka stream data.

## Setup and Configuration

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Kafka cluster with topics setup
- AWS S3 bucket
- ksqlDB server

### Installation


Before running the scripts, ensure you have Python installed on your system and the pip package manager is up to date. You can then install the necessary dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
